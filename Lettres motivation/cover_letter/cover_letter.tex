Dear members of the selection comitee,\\[1.5em]
%
It is with great enthusiasm that I hereby apply for participation in your event "SMC Insights – The Strategy Workshop".

\medskip

I am currently in my third year of Ph.D and intend to defend my dissertation before the end of 2018.
Therefore, my career plan currently is a central topic and making an informed choice for my future is particularly important to me.
I am confident that participating in your event is a great chance to gain a better overview of possible career paths, potentially even in your company.

\medskip

Even though I find great interest in my researches in university, the challenges of the industrial sector are quite appealing to me.
They are simultaneously astounding and exciting as solving them demands efforts of adaptation; technical and scientific innovation; and mobilization of material and human resources.
My interest in this has been sparked by my previous experiences, such as my internships at ONERA and CREST, or my study project jointly supervised by ENSAI and Thales.
My dedication to keep my technological knowledge up to date also allows me to keep track of recent advances and motivates personal projects.
Hopefully, these experiences and passion could allow me to become a driving force in large, ambitious, challenging projects.

\medskip

The experience I have acquired through my PhD would be valuable with for several reasons.
First, the theoretical knowledge I gained underlies many important tools of machine learning, which is nowadays an important vector of innovation.
Secondly, I have been able to initiate collaborative projects with some of my coworkers, merging our fields of competence and helping me to develop my teamwork skills.
Finally, attending my doctorate in Heidelberg, Germany, gave my first long-term work experience abroad.
This experience is very rewarding as I learned to adapt to a new environment, a new language and a new culture and I am eager to put a new spin on this process of discovery.

\medskip

For all these reasons, I have the feeling that working with you would be a great source of fulfillment through active participation in large scale projects, exchanging ideas with people from many fields and discovering the technical challenges which are inherent to different countries.
Therefore, I am in hope to meet you in March.

\medskip
