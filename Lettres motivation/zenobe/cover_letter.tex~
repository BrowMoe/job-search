To whom this concerns,

I am delighted to hereby apply to join Zenob\"e.
After working for nearly five years at the National Physical Laboratory, I intend to take the next important step in my career.
I am looking for the opportunity to take on more responsibilities in leadership and strategy.
While doing so, I want to remain an active scientist participating in exciting, scientifically challenging projects and to be part of a dynamic, inclusive team where all members feel encouraged to give their best while being themselves.

\medskip

Zenob\"e's mission impacts two key modern problematics I am passionate about: climate change and the accessibility of our cities.
The knowledge of positively contributing to society brought by climate change related projects is an essential motivator in my career.
Contributing to the elaboration of tools that empower citizens in fighting climate change, such as you do, is comething I would be honnored to participate in.
In addition, I am particularly pleased to see how closely you collaborate with public transport companies which represent the most viable future mean of transport in our cities.

\medskip

My experience in multi-disciplinary project teams, and diverse application areas is one of my key skills that I would put to use in your company.
I use state-of-the-art data science techniques with varieed data-types, and communicate their results to diverse types of audiences.
My collaborators are I take pride in delivering rigorous, reproducible and reusable work by applying quality processes.
I also contribute to the strategic vision of the laboratory by designing project proposals, applying for internal and external grants, being an active member of special interest groups, involving myself in the design of internal policies, leading recruitment interviews, and designing training material for recruits.
For all those reasons, I am confident I can positively impact your organisation and would be delighted to discuss our potential collaboration further with you soon.

\medskip

Respectfully yours,

Xavier Loizeau
