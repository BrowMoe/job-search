	Abstract = {{This book is a companion volume to the former book of the present
    author, {\it T. Lewis} and {\it B. J. J. Embleton}, ``Statistical analysis
    of spherical data.'' (1987; Zbl 0651.62045), but includes some newer
    techniques. It is primarily a manual for the working scientist, with the
    emphasis on applications. The level of mathematics required to use the book
    would be achieved by a first-year mathematics course. The emphasis is on
    statistical analysis of data, rather than on statistical theory.\par After
    an introduction, the chapter headings are: Descriptive methods; Models;
    Analysis of a single sample of data; Analysis of two or more samples, and of
    other experimental layouts; Correlation and regression; Analysis of data
    with temporal or spatial structure; Some modern statistical techniques for
    testing and estimation. Among the techniques covered in the last chapter are
    bootstrap methods.\par One appendix contains various statistical tables of
    probability distributions used in the analysis of circular data. A second
    appendix contains 24 data sets, drawn from various fields, including
    entomology, ornithology, herpetology, geology, meteorology, and others.
    Since this is not meant to be a textbook, there are no exercises, but there
    are many examples worked out in detail.}},
