We place ourselves in the framework introduced in \nref{INTRO_CIRCULARDECONVOLUTION}.
We will first consider the case of a known operator, first with independent data, then with an absolutely regular process.
We will then consider an unknown operator.
In all cases, we start by giving the explicit, detailed expression of the estimator, as well as the sequence which shall be proven o be an upper bound for the quadratic risk, before reminding the hypotheses to prove in order to obtain the convergence, we shall then proceed to show that the said hypothesis holds true before concluding.
The proofs for the results obtained in this section may be found in \nref{a:prel}.
