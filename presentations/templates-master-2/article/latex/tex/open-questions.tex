\section{Open questions}\label{VI}
Some questions are still open on a theoretical point of view.

First, one would give a better formulation of minimax optimality from a Bayesian point of view by widening the class of prior distribution among which the infimum is taken.

On the family of considered methods, it seems reasonable to hope to generalize the theoretical optimality to the case where $\lambda$ decreases exponentially.

Another interesting question is the the choice of $\eta$ on an optimal way, first depending on the class of $\theta^{\circ}$ and then on a data driven way.

\medskip

Another objective would be to generalize this method to the case where $\lambda$ is only estimated and not known and the case of a more general linear operator.
